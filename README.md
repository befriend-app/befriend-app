Please watch our [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAP_-f7f5fs) (~15 minutes) while following along our [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/befriend-app/befriend-backend?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-steps) for running the app locally successfully.   

## Vision

For over 2 decades, making friends has become increasingly harder as social media companies optimized for time spent in-app and ads served instead of optimal human experience.

Befriend is re-imagining how life on Earth can be, where loneliness and social isolation are no longer programmed into our way of being through a lack of choice in how we choose to spend our time: in-person or online.

Incorporated as a non-profit in December 2024, Befriend is developing an open-source global network of in-person networks to solve this multi-decade problem together.

This project's aim is to increase the consciousness of happiness on Earth while contributing to increased quality of life, better health, and more meaningful lives filled with in-person friendship and laughter every day of every year.
